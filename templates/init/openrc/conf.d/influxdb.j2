{#
# /usr/local/bin/influxdb/2.4.0/influxd --help

        Start up the daemon configured with flags/env vars/config file.

        The order of precedence for config options are as follows (1 highest, 3 lowest):
                1. flags
                2. env vars
                3. config file

        A config file can be provided via the INFLUXD_CONFIG_PATH env var. If a file is
        not provided via an env var, influxd will look in the current directory for a
        config.{json|toml|yaml|yml} file. If one does not exist, then it will continue unchanged.

Usage:
  influxd [flags]
  influxd [command]

Available Commands:
  downgrade    Downgrade metadata schema used by influxd to match the expectations of an older release
  help         Help about any command
  inspect      Commands for inspecting on-disk database data
  recovery     Commands used to recover / regenerate operator access to the DB
  run          Start the influxd server
  upgrade      Upgrade a 1.x version of InfluxDB
  version      Print the influxd server version

      --reporting-disabled                                              disable sending telemetry data to https://telemetry.influxdata.com every 8 hours

      --storage-cache-snapshot-memory-size Size                         The size at which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory. (default 25 MiB)
      --storage-cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration Duration             The length of time at which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes. (default 10m0s)

      --storage-write-timeout duration                                  The max amount of time the engine will spend completing a write request before cancelling with a timeout. (default 10s)

      --vault-client-timeout duration                                   timeout variable. The default value is 60s.
      --vault-max-retries int                                           maximum number of retries when a 5xx error code is encountered. The default is 2, for three total attempts. Set this to 0 or less to disable retrying.
      --vault-skip-verify                                               do not verify Vault's presented certificate before communicating with it. Setting this variable is not recommended and voids Vault's security model.
      --vault-tls-server-name string                                    name to use as the SNI host when connecting via TLS.
